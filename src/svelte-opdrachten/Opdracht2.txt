# Opdracht 2: Counter with Reset

## Goal
Build a simple counter component that can increment, decrement, and reset.

## Requirements

1. Create a reactive variable `count` that starts at 0
2. Create three buttons:
   - "+" button that increases count by 1
   - "-" button that decreases count by 1
   - "Reset" button that sets count back to 0
3. Display the current count value on the screen
4. **Challenge**: Use a ternary operator to change the text color:
   - Green when count is positive
   - Red when count is negative
   - White when count is 0

## Example Output
```
Count: 5

[+]  [-]  [Reset]
```

## Tips
- Remember: in Svelte, just reassigning a variable makes it reactive
- For the color challenge, you can use inline styles: `style="color: {condition ? 'green' : 'red'}"`
- Think about how to handle three conditions (positive, negative, zero) with ternary operators
