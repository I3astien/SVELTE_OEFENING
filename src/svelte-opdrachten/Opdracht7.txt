# Opdracht 7: Shopping Cart with Reactive Statements

## Goal
Practice reactive statements (`$:`) by building a simple shopping cart that calculates totals automatically.

## Requirements

1. Create variables for:
   - `price` (product price, default: 10)
   - `quantity` (number of items, default: 1)
2. Use a **reactive statement** to calculate `total` (price × quantity)
3. Display the price, quantity, and total
4. Add buttons to increase/decrease quantity
5. Show a discount message using a **reactive statement**:
   - If total > 50: show "10% discount applied!"
   - Calculate `finalPrice` with the discount (total × 0.9)
6. **Challenge**: Use a ternary operator with a reactive statement to show:
   - "Free shipping!" if total >= 30
   - "Add €X more for free shipping" if total < 30 (calculate the difference)

## Example Output
```
Shopping Cart

Price per item: €10
Quantity: [−] 3 [+]

Subtotal: €30.00
Free shipping! ✓

Total: €30.00
```

With discount:
```
Price per item: €10
Quantity: [−] 6 [+]

Subtotal: €60.00
10% discount applied!
Free shipping! ✓

Total: €54.00
```

## Tips
- Reactive statements with `$:`:
  ```svelte
  <script>
    let price = 10
    let quantity = 1

    // This automatically updates when price or quantity changes!
    $: total = price * quantity

    // You can use reactive statements for any computed value
    $: hasDiscount = total > 50
    $: finalPrice = hasDiscount ? total * 0.9 : total
  </script>
  ```
- Format currency: `€${number.toFixed(2)}`
- Prevent quantity going below 1
- Use ternary operators in reactive statements!
